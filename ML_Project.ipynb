    "The diamond industry is growing ~5% year on year, and the expertise required to define accurate prices has been limited to a few gemologists, making the process prone to discrepancies and inefficiencies. To maintain fair commerce and buyer trust, there needs to be a system that can accurately determine the price of a diamond based on various elements, including physical traits and quality parameters such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions (length, width, and depth).\n",
