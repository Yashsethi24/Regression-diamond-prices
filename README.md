Diamond Price Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting diamond prices using regression models. The goal is to build a robust machine learning pipeline that leverages regression algorithms to provide accurate price predictions based on diamond attributes.

## Project Overview
Diamond pricing is influenced by various attributes like carat, cut, color, clarity, and more. This project aims to:
- Understand and preprocess the diamond dataset.
- Explore various regression models.
- Evaluate and compare the models' performance.
- Provide insights into diamond pricing trends.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Insights into the dataset, visualizations, and trends.
- **Model Training:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Diamonds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/surajjha101/regression-models-diamond-price-prediction?select=diamonds.csv), which contains the following attributes:
- **Carat**
- **Cut**
- **Color**
- **Clarity**
- **Depth**
- **Table**
- **Price**

## Installation
To run the project, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yashsethi24/Regression-diamond-prices.git
cd Regression-diamond-prices
pip install -r requirements.txt
